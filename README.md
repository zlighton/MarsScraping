# MarsScraping
Scraped data from various sources using BeautifulSoup and Splinter and displayed them onto a basic Bootstrap template using Flask (last part still work in progress). 

The jupyter notebook contains all the code for the individual sections, put together in marsScrape.py to return a dictionary with all data. App.py is for Flask to deploy the data from MongoDB onto the HTML template.
